export const additionSectionToType = 'Hello reviewer! According to your task, I\'ve created this section where I can tell you about myself a bit more. I have hobbies like programming, investing, and playing chess(I have been playing chess for 7 years). My main focus is front-end development. I really love doing this. It\'s not only like a hobby I use all my knowledge to create bots, scripts, extensions, servers, and SPA which helps me to work with investments easily.You gave me a good chance to gain truly valuable experience and knowledge. I can\'t express how grateful I am for this opportunity :). Soon I\'ll face new challenges. Even one think about a chance to get practice in a real project ( with correct structure and beautiful code) makes me feel so excited'
